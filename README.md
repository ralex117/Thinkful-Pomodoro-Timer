# Thinkful-Pomodoro-Timer
The Pomodoro is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, 
traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

This timer was not complete and had some issues with the play/stop/pause button. I had to add in code that tied the components together to complete the project. I also learned that
ARIA is about accessibility and that something so simple such as a progress bar really pops for the user experience. 

This timer allows the user to change how long the work should last and how long the breaks are. You can also pause the timer if necessary.
